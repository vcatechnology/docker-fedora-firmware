This container derives from
[vcatechnology/fedora-ci](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/fedora-firmware) so that the
image has the latest [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) packages. It then
installs the some useful packages for building VCA firmware packages

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/fedora-firmware](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/fedora-firmware/)
